Olink Explore 1536 by Sweden's Olink Proteomics is a multiplex, proximity-extension immunoassay with next-generation sequencing readout on the Illumina NovaSeq platform. The semi-automated assay can measure more than 1,460 human proteins from less than 3 microliters of plasma or serum, enabling more than 1.35 million protein measurements per week per NGS system. These curated proteins provide coverage of the low-abundance plasma proteome.
